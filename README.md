# ROAD ACCIDENT CASUALITIES ANALYSIS DASHBOARD
---
## Project Overview
 This project present an interactive dashboard analyzing road accident casualties based on severity, weather conditions, vehicle type, road type, lighting conditions, and time trends. The goal is to uncover key insights that can help improve road safety and decision-making for policymakers, insurers, and transportation authorities.
 
 ### Dataset Overview
 The dataset contains accident casualties categorized by:
- Accident Severity: Fatal, Serious, Slight
- Weather Conditions: Fine, Rain, Snow, Fog, High Winds, etc.
- Vehicle Types: Cars, Motorcycles, Bicycles, Buses, etc.
- Road Types: Single Carriageway, Dual Carriageway, Roundabout, Slip Roads.
- Lighting Conditions: Daylight, Darkness with/without streetlights.
- Time Trends: Yearly, Monthly, and Weekly accident trends.
- Location Analysis: District-wise accident distribution.

### Steps For Analysis
 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removing missing/duplicate records
- Standardizing column names
- Filtering relevant accident attributes
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzing trends using pivot tables, charts, and graphs
- Identifying accident hotspots
- Dashboard Creation
- Identifying accident prone conditions
- Proposing road safety measures based on findings

  ### Tools
  Excel - (Power Query, Power Pivot) and Dashboard Creation

  ### Key Insight from the Dashboard

### Casualties by Severity

Total Casualties: 896,568 recorded.
Breakdown:
- Fatal: 16,483
- Serious: 129,439
- Slight: 750,646

- Trend:Slight casualties dominate, while fatal and serious cases remain significant.
  

### Weather Condition and Accidents

Highest Accidents Occur in Fine Weather: Contrary to assumptions, the highest accidents happen in fine weather with no high winds.
- Fine no high winds: 703,445 accidents in fine weather.
- Fog/Mist: 5126 casualties
- Rain + High Winds: 13,621 casualties
- Snow + High Winds: 1255 casualties
- Snowing no high winds: 8,370 casualities
- Raining no high winds: 112,229

- Conclusion: Adverse weather contributes, but most accidents occur under normal conditions.

  ### Casualties by Vehicle Type

 - Yearly Trends: Comparing 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, casualties show variations due to external factors (e.g., lockdowns).
 - Monthly Trends: Some months experience higher accident rates.
 - Daily Trends: Accidents peak on specific days of the week.

###  Recommendations for Road Safety Improvement
- Enhance Road Safety Awareness
Public Safety Campaigns: Increase awareness about accident prone conditions, even in fine weather where most accidents occur.
Driver Education Programs: Encourage safe driving habits, especially in urban areas with high casualty rates.
- Improve Traffic Management & Road Infrastructure
Better Road Lighting: Accidents occurred in darkness with streetlights lit, optimizing streetlight placement and intensity can improve visibility.
- Speed Control Measures: Implement speed limits on single carriageways, where most accidents occur.
Roundabout Safety Enhancements: Add clearer road signs and barriers to reduce collisions.

   Weather Responsive Road Safety Measures
Rain & Snow Precautions:
- Improve drainage systems to prevent water accumulation.
- Increase road grip solutions (e.g., anti skid surfaces).
- Fog & Mist Warning Systems:
- Use digital signboards to display real-time weather conditions.

Require fog lights during poor visibility conditions.
- Stricter Law Enforcement & Monitoring
Enforce Seatbelt & Helmet Laws: Target high risk vehicle types (e.g., motorcycles).
Expand CCTV & Speed Cameras: Reduce reckless driving and speeding in accident prone zones.
